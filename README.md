help a family of 5 people move across the river by boat and the boat is capable of a maximum of 2 people carrying capacity. Time for travelling of each person, in turn, is 1s, 3s, 6s, 8s and 12s. If two people both go on the boat, the boat will travel at the speed of the slower person. In the 30s please bring the whole family across the river.
